Allows you to load JavaScript in a much more controlled way using WordPress conditional tags.

== Description ==

JavaScript Logic is a plugin that allows you to add JavaScript however you want. There's no need to add a script on all of your blog's pages when you only need it on a few.

By using WordPress conditional tags or through a meta box on the Write Post/Page screen, you control what files are added to your site and when.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `javascript-logic` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to your 'Widgets' control panel and configure your new widgets.

More detailed instructions can be found in the plugin's `readme.html` file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why create this plugin? =

I use several scripts on my site to perform various tasks.  Usually, these scripts are only needed on a handful of pages.  But, if they're being loaded on every page of the site, things were running pretty slow.  So, I decided I needed an easy way to only load JavaScript when it was needed.

= What does this plugin do, exactly? =

It gives you a central control panel to load JavaScript on the pages of your choosing using WordPress <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags" title="Conditional Tags">conditional tags</a>.  Plus, on the *Write Post/Page* screen, there's an additional meta box that allows you to use JavaScript on a per-post/page basis.
